        Where have all the Pakistan fast bowlers gone?

    <span class='summary'>Pakistan is a proud cricketing nation and over the years our pride has been the number of high quality fast bowlers we have been able to produce. The list is a long one, 
        a famous one and one full of names that just flow from the lips of cricket lovers around the world. When I say fast bowlers, I don’t mean your medium fast bowlers or your dibbly dobbly medium pacers,
         what I am talking about are your out and out 90mph plus bowlers whose strength is raw pace. Our cricketing reputation is one that is based upon producing the best fast bowlers in the world and that reputation is in trouble.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="para">It pains me to admit this but over the course of the years, our fast bowling resources have gone from being our strength, to now being our weakness. I watched the World T20 with interest and watched our fast bowlers struggle 
        match after match, resulting in the captain only entrusting the fast bowlers with a couple of overs per match. However, it’s not just about the twenty over format that my concerns are based upon. In all formats of cricket our fast bowling resources
         have almost completely dried up and it concerns me to see the same mediocre bowlers being given chance after chance for Pakistan, instead of fresh and young blood being introduced.<br><br>
      
        I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the likes of Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman and Raza Hasan, as all three in my mind are excellent bowlers and have wonderful variety, but Pakistan’s over reliance on spin is becoming a huge concern.
    
        I don’t for a moment believe that there are no young fast bowlers in Pakistan, that is simply not possible. Why they aren’t making their way to international cricket is the question to ponder upon? What is happening to these fast bowlers 
        once they start playing U19 and junior cricket and why are so few of them performing to their optimum ability and making it to first class cricket and then onto international cricket? Why are so many of these boys disappearing down this “black hole”? <br><br>

        Fast bowling in Pakistan needs a revival, it needs a kick start, there needs to be a rethink and a reassessment of coaching methods and also the issue of the scouting network needs to be re-examined. I am certain that fast bowlers are not coming through the ranks 
        in the numbers that they should be coming through and how they used to in the past. In my days when I was playing first class cricket, every team had at least a couple of tearaway fast bowlers, nowadays you will be lucky to find a couple in the whole of the first class system. 
        Where is this talent disappearing and why is not being picked up by the regional selectors? There has to be a proper scouting network set up by the PCB to identify young talent from schools and ensure that talent is then nurtured through to U19 and onwards. At the moment far too 
        many quick bowlers are missing the boat and not being identified by the scouts and coaches around Pakistan.<br><br>

        I don’t trust this “talent hunt” system that the PCB is throwing all its energy into. There were talents hunts in the past too and very rarely did any one come through it. What they should be doing is sending their scouts and coaches all over Pakistan to watch school cricket, 
        and identifying the talent at a young age and then ensuring that talent is monitored regularly, coached properly and made part of the PCB database. Too often young cricketers are just being lost to a system which is outdated and based on luck and also based upon ex players stumbling 
        across exceptional cricketers by chance.
