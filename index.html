    <span class='summary'>Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan was elected 
    Pakistan's 22nd prime minister on Friday, marking the pinnacle of his 22-year-long political career.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="para">Khan clinched victory with 176 seats while his opponent, PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif, secured 96 votes in the polling that took place in the National Assembly today.

        As the newly elected speaker of the assembly, Asad Qaiser, announced the results, the House erupted with chants of "na manzoor"
         [unacceptable] and "Wazir-i-azam Nawaz Sharif" [PM Nawaz Sharif]. The protests by PML-N leaders continued nearly all the way through 
         the session despite the speaker's attempts at restoring order in the House.<br><br>
        Khan, in the meantime, sat smiling in his seat, accepting congratulations from his party members.

The speaker had suspended the proceedings of the National Assembly for 15 minutes after the crucial announcement due to the persistent sloganeering of PML-N legislators. 
Announcing the suspension of proceedings,Assembly Speaker Qaiser asked parliamentary leaders to come to his chamber.When the session resumed, the speaker asked the PM-elect to address 
the House as protests — by PML-N — and cheering — by PTI — continued. <a href="iknews.html">read more...</a></p>

        Where have all the Pakistan fast bowlers gone?
        <br>

    <span class='summary'>Pakistan is a proud cricketing nation and over the years our pride has been the number of high quality fast bowlers we have been able to produce. The list is a long one, 
        a famous one and one full of names that just flow from the lips of cricket lovers around the world. When I say fast bowlers, I don’t mean your medium fast bowlers or your dibbly dobbly medium pacers,
         what I am talking about are your out and out 90mph plus bowlers whose strength is raw pace. Our cricketing reputation is one that is based upon producing the best fast bowlers in the world and that reputation is in trouble.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="para">It pains me to admit this but over the course of the years, our fast bowling resources have gone from being our strength, to now being our weakness. I watched the World T20 with interest and watched our fast bowlers struggle 
        match after match, resulting in the captain only entrusting the fast bowlers with a couple of overs per match. However, it’s not just about the twenty over format that my concerns are based upon. In all formats of cricket our fast bowling resources
         have almost completely dried up and it concerns me to see the same mediocre bowlers being given chance after chance for Pakistan, instead of fresh and young blood being introduced.<br><br>
      
        I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the likes of Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman and Raza Hasan, as all three in my mind are excellent bowlers and have wonderful variety, but Pakistan’s over reliance on spin is becoming a huge concern. <a href="cricket.html">read more...</a></p>
